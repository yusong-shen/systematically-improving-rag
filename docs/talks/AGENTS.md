## Overview

This directory contains industry talks and presentations from the Systematically Improving RAG Applications series. Each talk provides insights from experts at companies like ChromaDB, Zapier, Glean, Exa, and others, covering practical RAG implementation strategies and lessons learned.

## File Structure

- **Industry expert talks**: 15+ markdown files covering specific RAG topics
- **Organized by chapter**: Talks align with workshop chapters (evaluation, training, UX, etc.)
- **Consistent format**: YAML frontmatter with catchy titles, descriptions, tags, speakers, and dates
- **Study notes format**: Key takeaways and technical insights highlighted

## Title Format Standards

All talk titles follow a **catchy, conversational format** designed to grab attention and communicate value:

### Title Pattern Examples:

- **"Why I Stopped Using RAG for Coding Agents (And You Should Too)"** - Personal story + actionable advice
- **"The RAG Mistakes That Are Killing Your AI (Lessons from Google & LinkedIn)"** - Problem identification + company credibility
- **"Stop Trusting MTEB Rankings - Here's How Chroma Actually Tests Embeddings"** - Contrarian take + insider knowledge
- **"The 12% RAG Performance Boost You're Missing (LanceDB's Re-ranking Secrets)"** - Specific benefit + insider secrets

### Title Principles:

- **Conversational tone**: Use "I", "You", "Why", "How" to make it personal
- **Specific benefits**: Include numbers, percentages, or concrete outcomes when possible
- **Company attribution**: Reference the company/organization for credibility
- **Controversial hooks**: Challenge conventional wisdom or common practices
- **Actionable implications**: Suggest there's something readers should do differently

## Content Standards

- **YAML frontmatter**: catchy title, speaker with company, description, tags, date
- **H1 title**: Matches the YAML title exactly for consistency
- **Study notes structure**: Technical insights with `**Key Takeaway:**` summaries
- **Question-answer format**: Practical insights organized by topic
- **Code examples**: Where applicable, include implementation details
- **Performance metrics**: Specific numbers and improvements mentioned

## Question Formatting Guidelines

**Main Section Questions**: Use proper markdown headers for navigable sections:

```markdown
## Why is accurate document parsing so critical for AI applications?

## How should you evaluate document parsing performance?

## What are the most challenging document elements to parse correctly?
```

**FAQ Section Questions**: Use bold emphasis within FAQ content:

```markdown
## FAQs

**What is document ingestion in the context of AI applications?**

Document ingestion refers to the process of extracting...

**Why is accurate document parsing so important for AI applications?**

Accurate parsing is critical because...
```

**Key Distinction**:

- `## Question?` = Main section headers (navigable, structured content)
- `**Question?**` = FAQ emphasis (within content sections only)
