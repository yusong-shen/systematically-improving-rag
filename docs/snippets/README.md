# MkDocs Snippets

This directory contains reusable content snippets that can be included in any markdown file using the MkDocs snippets feature.

## Available Snippets

### 1. `enrollment-button.md`

Simple enrollment button without additional styling:

```markdown
```

### 2. `enrollment-section.md`

Enrollment section with basic styling and explanatory text:

```markdown
--8<--
"snippets/enrollment-section.md"
--8<--
```

### 3. `enrollment-full.md`

Comprehensive enrollment section with gradient background and detailed copy:

```markdown
--8<--
"snippets/enrollment-full.md"
--8<--
```

## How to Use

1. **Include a snippet** in any markdown file using the `--8<--` syntax
2. **Customize the snippet** by editing the source file - changes will appear everywhere it's used
3. **Create new snippets** for other recurring content

## Benefits

- **Centralized content**: Update the enrollment button in one place
- **Consistent styling**: All instances use the same design
- **Easy maintenance**: No need to update multiple files
- **Version control**: Track changes to recurring content separately
