## How should I approach dynamic data visualization in AI-generated reports?

When creating AI-generated reports with dynamic visualizations, there are several approaches to consider depending on your specific needs.

For deep research-style reports (like those from Gemini, Claude, or OpenAI), the LLM typically decides on a set of subtasks and executes them sequentially. These reports often don't include charts or visualizations by default, though OpenAI's deep research does incorporate images.

For more structured reports with visualizations, I see three main approaches:

1. Post-hoc image addition: You can have the LLM identify places where supplementary images would enhance the text, then add them afterward.
1. Image citations during research: Treat images as another citation source that the LLM can reference while generating text. For example, with a client yesterday, the LLM decided to include an org chart in a leadership report because it had access to an org chart JPEG file during generation.
1. Mermaid diagrams: These are particularly useful for creating dynamic visualizations directly in Markdown. The key challenge is validation - if Claude generates an incorrect Mermaid diagram, it simply fails to render. You need a validation loop or external server to check the diagram code, report errors, and iterate to fix them.

For standard data visualizations, most companies use JavaScript libraries like Recharts, which allow you to pass data as props and generate visualizations.

The approach depends on whether your report format is flexible or fixed. If fixed, each header might have its own RAG workflow - for example, every competitor analysis might need a leadership team section, which triggers a subtask to find the leadership team of the target company.

## How can we handle styling challenges in professional reports?

One of the biggest challenges in AI report generation is matching the exact styling expectations of professional reports. I work with companies that sell to consultants like McKinsey, and the hardest part isn't generating the content - it's making the slides and plots look exactly like McKinsey-branded material.

While it's easy to plug in matplotlib or Recharts, it's extremely difficult to match the precise styling requirements of professional consulting firms. Some clients are literally saying, "We're not going to pay you any of that $80,000 unless you can make it look like we actually made this."

These firms often use specialized software from the early 2000s for plot generation, with very specific requirements about legend shapes, marker styles (X's versus T's), and other formatting details. The styling is so challenging that we're considering using computer vision to train systems to use PowerPoint and implement styling changes based on feedback comments.

I believe there's a significant market opportunity here - you could easily sell software that generates McKinsey-style plots for $100,000 to an analyst team. The last 5% of styling is what makes the difference between something that looks AI-generated versus professionally produced.

**_Key Takeaway:_** The styling challenge represents a major opportunity for AI tools that can match the exact visual requirements of professional consulting firms. The technical content generation is often easier than matching the precise styling expectations that make reports look professionally produced.

## How should I approach analyzing unstructured customer feedback data?

For a project like Netflix's customer feedback analysis, where you're collecting unstructured data through a "report a problem" feature, I recommend a hybrid approach combining semantic search with structured analysis.

First, consider doing hierarchical clustering to build a taxonomy of error categories. This gives you a structured way to analyze the data beyond just semantic search. By tagging all feedback with these hierarchical categories, you can provide accurate counts and faceted navigation.

When a user asks "What are members saying about Seinfeld's aspect ratio?", you might return 10-20 semantically relevant results, but also show facets like "200 comments in this category, 80 in that category" to help them understand the distribution of issues.

This approach allows users to traverse the data in interesting ways - they might start with audio issues, discover that 20% of complaints are about Seinfeld, then dig into which season has the most problems. The goal is giving users a portfolio of tools to explore the hierarchy rather than just semantic search alone.

For quantitative questions like "How many audio sync issues were reported in Brazil last month?", you need structured data. The LLM will hallucinate counts if you rely solely on semantic search. By building lightweight classifiers for common issues, you can provide accurate counts while still allowing semantic exploration of the unstructured text.

I worked with a company called Interpret that built something similar - a chatbot that could talk to customer feedback and give realistic counts by combining semantic understanding with structured analysis.

**_Key Takeaway:_** The most effective approach combines semantic search with structured analysis through hierarchical clustering and classification. This gives users both the flexibility to explore feedback semantically and the accuracy of structured data for quantitative questions.

## What's the best way to build fast classifiers for unstructured data?

When you need to quickly classify unstructured data, there are several approaches depending on your requirements.

One approach is using embedding-based classification. As Jan mentioned, OpenAI's documentation describes a simple technique where you embed category descriptions and then classify items by finding the closest category embedding. This works well for straightforward classification tasks and is extremely fast to implement.

In my previous work, we used a matrix-based approach where we'd embed all products in a matrix, then learn another matrix to multiply by the product embeddings whenever we needed to build a classifier. This allowed us to label about 1,000 examples, learn the weights, and then multiply the entire product space by that vector to get predictions for every product. It was very fast but typically achieved around 85% accuracy.

For Netflix's feedback analysis, you might want to combine pre-defined categories from domain experts with data-driven clusters discovered through analysis. There will be common issues like rendering problems or audio sync issues that domain experts can define, plus a longer tail of soft clusters that emerge from the data.

The key is building a system that can quickly create and apply these classifiers as new issues emerge. When a new feature launches, you want to detect feedback about it immediately, even if it wasn't in your training data.

**_Key Takeaway:_** Fast classifier development is essential for responsive feedback analysis. Combining embedding-based approaches with domain expertise allows you to quickly identify both known issues and emerging patterns in user feedback.

## How should we think about tool-based approaches versus semantic search?

I believe we're moving toward a world where many RAG applications will use tool-based approaches rather than pure semantic search, especially for structured data.

In the coming weeks, we'll have talks from teams building coding agents that use a portfolio of tools rather than semantic search. Their thesis is that for structured data, the right way to prepare context isn't one semantic search request, but an agent using multiple tools to build context incrementally.

Think about how you debug an error message - you see the error came from a specific file, so you load that file, then you find the function causing the issue, load that file, and traverse the file tree building context before solving the problem. Coding agents are implementing this approach rather than embedding all code.

You can implement this with simple tools like "ls" (list files), "read_file", and "grep". The agent uses these tools to navigate the data, building context as it goes. This approach might cost more at query time but requires less preprocessing of data.

I'm curious if this approach would work for traversing complex documents like 1,000-page PDFs. Instead of embedding everything, you could provide tools like "list_table_of_contents", "grep", "show_page", and "show_page_as_image". The agent could navigate the document naturally, finding references and following them just as a human would.

**_Key Takeaway:_** Semantic search is most valuable when the producer and consumer of data don't share vocabulary. For structured data or documents with clear organization, a tool-based approach that mimics human navigation may be more effective and require less preprocessing.

## What are you working on with your Cura project?

We're making progress on building out Cura, which is an open-source project (not quite a product yet) focused on analyzing conversation data. In the next few days, we'll be benchmarking it on about a thousand conversations to see what patterns we discover.

The core of the project involves hierarchical clustering, explaining clusters, and generating names for these clusters. We're planning to download every open-source chat conversation dataset and run our analysis on it to see what we find.

My philosophy with any product I build is that it should function as a sensor that generates data. I want to "trick" users into labeling data for me. If I don't know which chart type works best, I'll generate three options and ask users to delete the ones they don't want. My messaging is that it's important for them to review the data, but I'm actually collecting valuable feedback on what visualizations work best.

We apply the same approach to citations in paragraphs - users can mouse over citations to see the source data and delete or regenerate citations they don't trust. This creates a feedback loop that continuously improves the system.

**_Key Takeaway:_** Building products that function as data collection sensors is a powerful approach. By giving users options and tracking their choices, you can gather valuable feedback that improves your system while providing a better user experience.

## What upcoming content are you excited about in the course?

I'm particularly excited about the second half of the course where we'll dive deeper into data analysis and explore the portfolio of tools approach.

In the coming weeks, we'll have talks from Reducto, one of the best PDF parsing libraries available right now. They have contracts with companies like Vanta and government agencies and have achieved impressive results.

We'll also be inviting teams building coding agents, including the Augment team and the Klein team. These companies are focusing less on RAG with semantic search and more on RAG using a portfolio of tools. Their thesis is that for structured data like code, the right approach isn't one semantic search request but an agent using multiple tools to build context.

Beyond the course, I'm organizing a speaker series with guests from OpenAI's memory team and possibly Claude Code. My goal is to bring in the most interesting speakers in the field to share their insights.

**_Key Takeaway:_** The future of RAG systems, especially for structured data like code, may involve less semantic search and more tool-based approaches where agents navigate information using a portfolio of tools to build context incrementally.
