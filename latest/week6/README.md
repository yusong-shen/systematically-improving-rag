# Week 6: Tool Selection and Orchestration

## Overview

This final week extends RAG systems beyond retrieval to encompass tool orchestration - the ability to select and coordinate multiple specialized capabilities. Modern AI applications rarely rely on retrieval alone; they need to search databases, call APIs, execute code, and combine results from multiple sources. This week applies the same systematic improvement methodology to tool selection that previous weeks applied to retrieval.

The approach follows a familiar pattern: first establish metrics to measure tool selection quality, then generate test cases that expose weaknesses, and finally implement targeted improvements. Through this process, you'll see how simple changes like better system prompts and few-shot examples can dramatically improve tool selection accuracy, enabling your RAG system to handle complex, multi-step tasks that require coordinating various capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you'll be able to:

- Define and calculate precision and recall metrics for tool selection
- Generate synthetic test cases targeting tool selection failure modes
- Implement effective system prompts that improve tool selection accuracy
- Create few-shot examples that demonstrate correct tool usage patterns
- Compare sequential vs. parallel tool execution strategies
- Analyze per-tool performance to identify specific weaknesses
- Achieve 75%+ improvements in tool selection metrics through systematic optimization

## Datasets

- **Command Library**: 70+ available tools with descriptions and usage patterns
- **Test Queries**: Synthetic queries requiring various tool combinations
- **Performance Results**: Tracking improvements across different optimization strategies

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this week's materials, you'll have:

1. A robust evaluation framework for tool selection quality
2. Comprehensive test suite exposing tool selection weaknesses
3. Optimized system achieving 75%+ improvement in selection accuracy
4. Clear understanding of which prompting techniques work best
5. Framework applicable to any tool orchestration challenge

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: High false positive rate in tool selection

**Solution**: Add negative examples in few-shot prompts showing when NOT to use certain tools.

### Issue 2: Tools being called in wrong order

**Solution**: Include sequential dependencies in system prompt and demonstrate correct ordering in examples.

### Issue 3: Inconsistent performance across different query types

**Solution**: Analyze per-category performance and add targeted few-shot examples for weak areas.

## Next Steps

- Complete notebooks in sequence to build understanding
- Experiment with different system prompts for your use case
- Apply these techniques to your own tool libraries
- Consider implementing tool selection monitoring in production
