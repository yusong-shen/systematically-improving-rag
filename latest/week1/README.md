# Week 1: Building Your RAG Evaluation Foundation

## Overview

This week establishes the fundamental evaluation framework needed to systematically improve RAG applications. Rather than randomly trying different retrieval techniques and hoping for improvement, you'll build a rigorous testing framework that measures performance objectively. This approach ensures every change you make is backed by data, not intuition.

The evaluation framework consists of three essential components: synthetic question generation for creating challenging test cases, benchmarking tools for measuring retrieval performance across different approaches, and statistical validation to ensure improvements are real rather than random variation. Together, these create a scientific approach to RAG improvement that will guide all future optimization efforts in this course.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you'll be able to:

- Generate diverse, realistic synthetic questions that challenge your RAG system
- Implement key retrieval metrics (recall@k, MRR@k) to measure performance objectively
- Compare multiple retrieval strategies using controlled experiments
- Apply statistical methods to verify that improvements are significant
- Deploy open-source models for cost-effective evaluation at scale
- Track and visualize experiment results using modern ML tools

## Datasets

- **Bird-Bench**: A challenging dataset of SQL queries and database schemas from "567-labs/bird-rag", used as source documents for generating synthetic questions
- **Synthetic Questions**: Generated dataset of diverse questions targeting different retrieval challenges

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this week's materials, you'll have:

1. A robust synthetic question generation pipeline producing hundreds of diverse test cases
2. A comprehensive benchmarking framework comparing multiple retrieval strategies
3. Statistical validation tools proving which improvements are significant
4. Clear performance metrics showing baseline retrieval capabilities
5. Experience with modern ML experiment tracking and visualization

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Rate limiting when generating synthetic questions

**Solution**: Implement exponential backoff and use the provided async rate limiting patterns. Consider using Modal deployment for higher throughput.

### Issue 2: Inconsistent results between benchmark runs

**Solution**: Ensure you're using the same random seed for reproducibility. Check that your evaluation dataset hasn't changed between runs.

### Issue 3: Statistical tests showing no significant differences

**Solution**: Increase your sample size or ensure your test cases are sufficiently challenging to reveal performance differences.

## Next Steps

- Complete all notebooks in order (synthetic questions → benchmarking → visualization)
- Review Week 2 on fine-tuning to understand how baseline metrics guide improvement efforts
- Experiment with different question generation prompts to create even more challenging test cases
